This is a **markdown** file. Markdown is a "syntax" that allows us to write simple text that can be transformed into HTML. (*HTML is a **mark-up** language.*)

We can make text that is **bold** or *italic* by wrapping the words or phrases in either double or single asterixes

We can also create lists, like the following un-ordered list.

- First item
- Second Item
- Third Item
